Photography Management is a plugin for professional photographers and designers, who need to provide their clients/customers with images
and photographs. It also allows to manage the designer's clients and projects.
Your photographs are only uploaded to your own Wordpress server, where you can easily password protect your galleries, such that only selected people can access it.
Just send your customer a mail with the link to the gallery and the password which you have set previously in Photography Management.
Now only this specific customer can access your gallery, watch it and download a zip file of the gallery.

This plugin is popular amongst wedding photographers, Web designers and artists. Clients can proof your photographs be simply clicking on a star icon.
